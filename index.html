        <p>
          Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in
          western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of
          his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
          part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills,
          Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi
          sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha
          Empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent
          and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military
          and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is
          well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around
          non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors like geography,
          speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
